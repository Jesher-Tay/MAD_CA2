//To run
npx expo start --tunnel


Due to time constraint, I can't fix the issue found on the profile page's materialTopTab's TouchableOpacity is not working as intented (supposed to navigate to Eateries in the card through Stack Navigator)

So for now that page has been moved to the first row of the 'Explore page' TouchbleOpacities, the rest of the rows in the Explore Page will navigate to the Eatery page.
